# Iris Flower Classification – CodSoft Internship

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using sepal and petal measurements.

## Dataset
Iris Flower Dataset (Kaggle).

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Workflow
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Cleaned and preprocessed data
- Visualized feature relationships
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated model performance

## Results
The model achieved good accuracy in classifying all three Iris species.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates basic data analysis, visualization, and machine learning classification skills.
